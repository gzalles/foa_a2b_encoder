# foa_a2b_encoder
GUI in Matlab for encoding soundfield recordings

# why
Allows you to encode the soundfield outside a DAW. B-format files can then be used in Unity or WebAudio experiences. No more routing or unnecessary sessions.

If you have Octave I believe the script without the GUI will still work.
